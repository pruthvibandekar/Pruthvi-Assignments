# Python Data Type Methods with `help()`

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the methods of Python's built-in data types (`int`, `float`, `complex`, `list`, `tuple`, `str`, `set`, `dict`, `bool`) with practical examples and the use of Python's `help()` function for interactive documentation.

## Overview

The notebook provides:
- **Examples**: Demonstrations of commonly used methods for each data type.
- **Documentation**: Use of `help()` to display detailed information about each data type, including all available methods and attributes.
- **Interactive Learning**: Designed to run in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for hands-on exploration.

This is a useful resource for Python learners, developers, or anyone looking to understand the capabilities of Python's core data types.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, youâ€™ll need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. You can install it via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install notebook

# Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing

This repository documents a use case for **Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing**, leveraging data analytics and machine learning to predict equipment failures, reduce downtime, and optimize maintenance costs.

## Overview

Predictive maintenance uses data from various sources to anticipate machine failures before they occur, offering a proactive alternative to traditional reactive and preventive maintenance approaches. This approach helps manufacturers minimize unplanned downtime, improve operational efficiency, and lower maintenance expenses.

- **Flowchart**: A visual representation of the predictive maintenance process (see below).

## Use Case: Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing

### 1. Data

#### Data Sources
The predictive maintenance system relies on data collected from multiple sources:
- **IoT Sensors**: Temperature, vibration, pressure, humidity, and acoustic sensors attached to machinery.
- **Machine Logs**: Error logs, warnings, and operational status logs generated by machines.
- **Maintenance Records**: Historical data on past breakdowns, repairs, and servicing schedules.
- **Production Data**: Workload, production cycles, and operational efficiency information.
- **External Data**: Weather conditions, power fluctuations, and supplier-related issues affecting machine performance.

#### Data Issues
Challenges in the data include:
- **Missing Data**: Gaps in time-series data due to sensor failures.
- **Noisy Data**: Inaccurate sensor readings caused by environmental interference.
- **Data Redundancy**: Duplication from overlapping sensor parameters, increasing storage and processing costs.
- **Data Drift**: Changes in sensor behavior over time due to wear and tear, impacting model accuracy.
- **Latency Issues**: Delays in real-time data collection due to network constraints.

#### Types of Data
- **Structured Data**:
  - Machine ID, sensor readings, timestamps (stored in relational databases).
  - Maintenance history, repair logs, failure records.
- **Unstructured Data**:
  - Technician reports, audio signals, thermal camera images.
- **Time-Series Data**:
  - Continuous sensor readings over time, essential for anomaly detection and trend analysis.

### 2. Problem Statement

Manufacturing companies face unexpected machine failures, resulting in unplanned downtime and production losses. Traditional maintenance strategies (reactive and preventive) are inefficient and costly.

#### Objective
Develop a **predictive maintenance system** using machine learning to:
- Analyze real-time sensor data.
- Detect anomalies in machine behavior.
- Identify failure patterns and potential causes.
- Recommend optimal maintenance schedules to minimize downtime and costs.
